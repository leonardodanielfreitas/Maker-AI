# **Changelog**

News from the Makerengineering team.

<Update label="06/12/2025" description="">
  Here everything we shipped the last two weeks:

  **Spotlight**

  - Enhanced project discoverability with new filtering options to easily find and manage your projects.
  - Added categorization to community projects to make it easier to discover projects by the community.

  **Improvements**

  - Chat mode now renders Mermaid diagrams to help visualize your app’s back-end logic and structure (ask for it to chart things to trigger this).
  - Auto-configure redirect URLs for Supabase Auth integration - no more manual configuration needed for a more seamless authentication setup.
  - Added in-product feedback system - click the thumbs down button when edits cause issues to help us improve Lovable’s AI for everyone.
  - Introduced smart nudges to guide you to Chat Mode when debugging issues that need conversational help.
  - Edit history now shows screenshot previews on hover, letting you quickly see what your app looked like at different stages without opening each version.

  **Security**

  - Added API key detection in chat that warns you before accidentally sharing sensitive information like secrets.
  - Rolled out AI-powered “Security review” feature to help identify potential vulnerabilities in your apps. Trigger it before publishing your app via the publish modal.
