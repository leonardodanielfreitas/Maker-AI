## What is Maker

**MAKER**  
*Enabling everyday visionaries to achieve breakthroughs through language-based engineering.*

Maker is an AI-powered platform that lets you create and deploy apps from a single browser tab. It removes the complexities of traditional app development by unifying coding, deployment, and collaboration tools in one interface.

Normally, building an app requires installing frameworks, languages, and packages. With Maker, however, you can rely on AI to configure your development environment automatically, allowing you to start building without any coding experience.

The platform supports a full-featured development environment that works for users who can code as well as those who cannot, so there’s virtually no limit to what you can create.

- Generate a complete app (with initial setup) from a natural language description.  
- AI-powered code suggestions and autocompletion.  
- Automatic error detection with AI-assisted debugging.  
- Built-in generation of documentation for your app.  
- Cloud deployment in just a few clicks.  
- Integrated database and hosting via native Supabase support.  
- Support for connecting custom domains.
